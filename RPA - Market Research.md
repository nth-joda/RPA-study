# RPA - Robotic Process Automation

## I. Types of RPA

---

- Supervised RPA = System + Human
- Unsupervised RPA = Only System
- Hybrid RPA = System + Optional Human

## II. RPA vs AI

---

- RPA = hands / legs (take robot out of human)
- AI = brain (put human into robot )

## III. Which factors should you consider while selecting a RPA Software?

---

You should consider the following factors before selecting a tool:

- Desired **Platform Support**: Web, Desktop, Citrix, SAP, etc
- **License Cost** if applicable
- In the case of an outsourcing project, you need to factor customer/Client preference of the automation tool
- The cost involved in **training employees** on the tool
- **Hardware/Software requirements** of the automation tool
- Support and Update policy of the automation tool vendor.

   - **Advantages**:
     - Cloud-native and web based AI platform (a Web-Based Management System which uses a Control Room to run the Automated Tasks)
     - Create and maintain a digital workforce of software bots that complete end-to-end business processes
     - Drag and drop features
     - Has hands-on tutorials and webinars, as well as extensive modular training.
   - **Features:**

     - a) Task editor
       - Keyboard & Mouse actions
       - Windows actions
       - Database actions
       - Conditional Actions
       - Files/Folder Actions
       - Loop actions
       - Internet actions
       - Clipboard actions
     - b) Workflow designer

       - To automate multiple tasks in a queue, including alternate path locations, that is executed when there is any failure in the primary process execution.

     - c) Report Designer

       - To generate and print the insight that displays the statistics of the execution logs of any particular task. It can also be used to create custom reports or insights. The report designer provides options such as Workflow Timeline, Task Timeline, Task Run, Visual Logs, and ROI reports, etc.

     - d) Trigger Manager

       - To process any task or workflow based on the other process, service, or task such as start/stop, system change, file or folder change, etc.

     - e) Workload Management

       - To prioritize the process for execution. Workload management (WLM) allows enterprises to manually set the high-value processes inside the automated queue to fulfill the enterprise's requirements. It uses hundreds or thousands of software bots to satisfy the demand and ensures better optimization for process automation.

     - f) Recorders

       - To record, save, and test their actions. It follows the user's actions and creates a bot according to it. There are no programming skills required to develop bots as recording any task is more straightforward than manually coding it. There are three types of recording option available in Automation Anywhere:
         - **Smart Recorder**: It is used to capture whole actions, just like object cloning.
         - **Screen Recorder**: It is used to capture actions like mouse clicks and movements, keyboard operations, etc.
         - **Web Recorder**: It is used for extracting data from the web. It accurately records user-actions and further automates web-based tasks without the requirement of any coding or programming language.

     - g) Image Recognition and OCR
       - To read objects of an image as well as compare it with other images. It can also read or recognize an image from any document or the entire web page. Similarly, OCR (Optical Character Recognition) recognizes an image and converts the image data into text or characters in an excellent way.

      - Source control : code for the bots is managed by the control room. So it becomes easy to share the code across different systems.
      - Dashboard- It gives complete analytics/results of Automation Anywhere bots. You can see how many bots are runs and how bot failed/passed etc. is controlled.
      - License Management: The purchased licenses for Automation Anywhere are configured in the Control Room
      - Dev license: can create a bot, edit bot and run a bot.
      - Run license: run the bot and,will not make any changes.

   - **Features:**
     - Secure, scalable, and central management of a virtual workforce of software robots
     - Complete automation solution that results in work distribution and queue management
     - Blue prism has many robust features like load balancing, encryption, and audit. It also offers robots that are defined and managed centrally
     - Blue Prism automation tool comes with various types of spying modes for different application types
     - It has many improved features to configure Dashboards so that session information can be directed to external Analytics and monitoring systems
     - The latest version 6 of Blue prism provide support for Microsoft Azure and Amazon AWS cloud deployment patterns
     - Exception stages can be set to save a screen capture. When it is used in the production environment, this feature can resolve resource processing issues in a secure manner
   - **Components:**

     - Blue Prism is a set of libraries, tools, and runtime environments for RPA.
     - Every software robot has two main parts:

       - _Process Studio:_ is an area where an actual process is created. It looks similar to a traditional flowchart. It allows business logic, control loops, variables, and object calls to be sequenced and tested in a visible business flow. Each page in a process has its tab, and generally, the process defined in the Process Studio is similar to a flowchart. A process acts like a human user. It implements a software robot’s logic. It is almost similar to personal interaction with several applications to carry out a series of steps which can invoke actions to carry out the same steps.

       - _Object Studio:_ is used for building different objects. Object studio is the place where we can create the Visual Business Object. It is abbreviated as VBO. VBO is created to interact with other applications. There are different types of actions that can be performed within these objects in the Object Studio. We will see that Object Studio looks very like Process Studio. There are key differences, which are:
         - Object Studio offers some “stage” which are not available in the Process Studio
         - Object Studio does not have a Main Page, but it does have two default pages
         - Pages are organized as a flat group instead of hierarchy like in the Process Studio

   - **Process diagram:**
     - Process diagrams are composed of various stages connected together using links to form logical structures.
     - Stages are selected from the toolbar and placed on the diagram using the mouse.
     - They can be selected, moved, resized, formatted, cut, copied, pasted, and deleted, much as you might expect.
     - Stages also have various properties that can be accessed by double -clicking.
     - Links are created using the link tool by dragging the mouse from the center of one stage to the center of another.
     - Dragging without the link tool can be used to select more than one stage at a time.
